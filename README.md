# akurAI
AkurAI is a Sinhala character recognition system built initially using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It focuses on classifying individual Sinhala characters from handwritten or printed input. The project aims to evolve into a complete AI-powered OCR solution by progressively incorporating more advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.
